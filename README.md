# AWS-CoffeeInsight
"AWS CoffeeInsight" is a data analytics project that utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) to analyze and visualize coffee distribution data. The project involves storing the dataset in Amazon S3, discovering its schema using AWS Glue, preparing the data with Amazon Athena, and generating insights through visualizations with Amazon QuickSight.

Transforming raw coffee distribution data into actionable insights involves a streamlined process leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) capabilities:
 
  **1. Data Storage:** Store the coffee distribution dataset in an Amazon S3 bucket for secure and scalable storage.

  **2. Schema Discovery:** Use AWS Glue crawlers to automatically detect the dataset's schema and store it in the AWS Glue Data Catalog for easy management.

  **3. Data Preparation:** Employ Amazon Athena for efficient data preparation, enabling quick querying and transformation tasks.

  **4. Insight Generation:** Utilize Amazon QuickSight to query the prepared data and create visualizations, facilitating the discovery of insights into coffee distribution trends and performance metrics.
